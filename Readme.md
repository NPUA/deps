# Department enhancement proposals (DEPs)

DEPs are a way of documentint what it would be "nice to have" at ISSD department. They rather are long-term goals then tasks that can be immediately executed.

[DEP-0](dep-0.md) describes the structure of a DEP.  
[DEP-1](dep-1.md) describes the lifecycle of a DEP.

They all can be found [here](https://github.com/NPUA/deps).
